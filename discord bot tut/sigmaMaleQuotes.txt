STAND OUT never try to blend in
We dont have to fear anything except Fear itself
A noguts guy can never taste glory
Dont worry Theres a beast inside every man that protects a queen
You have to behave like a queen if you want to be treated like a queen
There are just as many thoughts in the world as there are people
A man does not list his achievements they speak for himself
for starters we were just strangers
Im not a thief Im just taking what belongs to me
Once you learn to practice love your life becomes a masterpiece
It isnt always going to be convenient but always try to do whats right
He turned his cants into cans and prepared for his dreams
Whilst navigating through Instagram the reality is what happens to you
A day in my life Eat avocado toast post videos on Instagram and respond to comments on Instagram
Ive earned it its my turn to step into the spotlight
I just practice what Im writing
Responsibilities are what kills the fun of adulthood
Anything you see around you started out as an idea much like the one you want to forget so hard
A man can never relax until his dream happens
Dont rejoice too much its just one mile in a marathon
I am using the tbt to remind myself where I came from
my mums prayers brought me here
If success could talk the sleepless nights and long hours would say
On average success is rarely
Im still the best of myself
Im jealous of my parents Ill never get as good a kid as theirs
God bless this mess
Im the quiet type of guy that will surprise you when they decide to talk
The world needs beastly creatures
Just be yourself Unless youre a psychopath
Enough reading already Go make a difference not just a living
I dont care what people think unless its about me
As sad as it might be you have to be alone sometimes in your life to get things done
Dont care what they think they dont know what that means to you
You cant make people respect you so theyre going to have no choice but to accept you
Being strong is when you hold your ground stand up for yourself and say No Youre not going to screw with me
I dont suffer from insanity I enjoy every minute of it
Not only I survived but thrived for I am born to be a Sigma male
Nowadays the alpha male is the loser and the sigma male is the winner
Men dont come of age they come of wisdom
I dont care what people think or say about me I was not put on earth to entertain everyone
I have no need for anyone to tell me who I am I am the master of my own destiny and the captain of my soul
